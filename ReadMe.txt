NeuroAI test is still in alpha. This is a test based on a website article I found based on the 
idea of learning AI. The basic idea is a person or animal press a button, and if they get the right button they get food.
If they press the wrong button they get nothing. After each time the person/animal press the button,
the value get updated based on if it found it's food. If it finds food, the person/animal will be more likely to chose that button again.
If it doesn't get the food, it'll decrease the likelihood it'll chose that button again.
